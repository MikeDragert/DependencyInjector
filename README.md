# Dependency Injection Example

This is a simple C# project to demonstrate use of an Interface, classes that implement those interfaces, and using various types of dependency injection to supply implementations of the interface to code that uses the interface. 
By injecting different types of implementations of the Interface (IMathOperation), we can change the behaviour of the code by only changing the interface implementation that is injected in.

Three types of dependency injection are demonstrated.
- Constructor Dependency Injection
- Property Dependency Injection
- Method Dependency Injection

This is a small project written in visual studio 2022

# Dependencies
